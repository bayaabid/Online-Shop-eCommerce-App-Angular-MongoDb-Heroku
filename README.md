Welcome to `product mart` this is an Angular App where we are using Angular Material to develop pages and we are making this app from the scratch to learn angular.

This course is introduction to `MEAN` stack step by step.
The `MEAN` stack uses `Mongo`, `Express`, `Angular` and `Node` for simple and scalable fullstack js applications

- [x] M = MONGO DB
- [x] E = EXPRESS
- [x] A = ANGULAR
- [x] N = NODE.JS

## Learning Checklist

Below are our learning checklist. We will cover one by one each topic while making this website and hence completing our `MEAN` Stack Learning.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
